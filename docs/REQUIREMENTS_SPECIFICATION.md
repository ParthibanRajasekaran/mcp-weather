# 🎯 MCP Weather Server Requirements Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the critical and non-critical requirements for the MCP Weather Server, written in Gherkin format as an outcome of example mapping sessions. Each requirement is categorized by criticality and mapped to acceptance tests.

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (Pipeline-Blocking)

### CR-01: MCP Protocol Compliance
**Epic**: As an AI assistant, I need the server to follow MCP protocol exactly so I can integrate successfully

#### Scenario: Tool Discovery Must Follow MCP Schema
```gherkin
Given an MCP client connects to the weather server
When the client requests tool discovery
Then the server must return a valid MCP tools list
And each tool must have name, description, and inputSchema
And the schema must follow JSON Schema specification
And the response must be valid JSON-RPC 2.0 format
```

#### Scenario: Tool Execution Must Return Valid MCP Response
```gherkin
Given an MCP client has discovered available tools
When the client calls the "getWeather" tool with valid parameters
Then the server must return an MCP-compliant response
And the response must have "content" array with "type" and "text" fields
And the response must not contain any protocol violations
```

#### Scenario: Error Responses Must Follow MCP Format
```gherkin
Given an MCP client calls a tool with invalid parameters
When the server encounters an error
Then the server must return a properly formatted MCP error response
And the error must include a clear, user-friendly message
And the error must not expose internal system details
```

### CR-02: Core Weather Functionality
**Epic**: As a user, I need reliable weather data for any valid city

#### Scenario: Valid City Weather Retrieval
```gherkin
Given the weather service is available
When I request weather for a valid city like "London"
Then I should receive current weather data
And the data should include temperature, apparent temperature, and conditions
And the data should include location coordinates
And the response should be returned within 15 seconds
```

#### Scenario: Invalid City Handling
```gherkin
Given the weather service is available
When I request weather for an invalid city like "NonExistentCity123"
Then I should receive a clear error message
And the message should indicate the city was not found
And the message should suggest checking spelling
And the message should not expose any user input for security
```

#### Scenario: Empty Input Validation
```gherkin
Given the weather service is available
When I request weather with an empty city name
Then I should receive a validation error
And the error should indicate that city name is required
And the server should not attempt external API calls
```

### CR-03: Security and Input Sanitization
**Epic**: As a system administrator, I need the server to be secure against attacks

#### Scenario: SQL Injection Prevention
```gherkin
Given a malicious user provides SQL injection input
When they call getWeather with city: "'; DROP TABLE cities; --"
Then the server must sanitize the input
And the server must not execute any SQL commands
And the error message must not reveal the attempted injection
And the response should be a safe "city not found" message
```

#### Scenario: XSS Prevention in Responses
```gherkin
Given a user provides XSS input
When they call getWeather with city: "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
Then the server must sanitize the input
And the response must not contain executable script tags
And the error message must be safe for display in web interfaces
```

#### Scenario: Error Message Security
```gherkin
Given the server encounters any error condition
When returning error messages to the client
Then the error message must not expose file paths
And the error message must not expose API keys or credentials
And the error message must not expose internal service details
And the error message must be safe for display to end users
```

### CR-04: Performance and Availability
**Epic**: As an AI assistant, I need fast, reliable responses for real-time user interactions

#### Scenario: Response Time SLA Compliance
```gherkin
Given the weather server is running normally
When a client requests weather for any valid city
Then the response must be returned within 15 seconds
And 95% of requests must complete within 8 seconds
And tool discovery must complete within 1 second
```

#### Scenario: Concurrent Request Handling
```gherkin
Given multiple AI assistants are using the server
When 5 concurrent weather requests are made
Then all requests must be processed successfully
And no request should timeout due to concurrency
And memory usage should remain stable during concurrent load
```

#### Scenario: External API Failure Resilience
```gherkin
Given the external weather API is unavailable
When a client requests weather data
Then the server must return a graceful error message
And the server must not crash or become unresponsive
And subsequent requests after API recovery must work normally
```

## 🟡 NON-CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (Quality Improvements)

### NCR-01: Enhanced User Experience
**Epic**: As a user, I want helpful and informative responses

#### Scenario: Rich Weather Data Display
```gherkin
Given I request weather for a valid city
When the server returns weather data
Then the response should include hourly forecasts
And the response should include timezone information
And the data should be formatted for easy reading
```

#### Scenario: City Name Flexibility
```gherkin
Given I want weather for a city with special characters
When I request weather for "São Paulo" or "Zürich"
Then the server should handle international characters correctly
And the response should include proper location data
```

#### Scenario: Helpful Error Suggestions
```gherkin
Given I make a typo in a city name
When I request weather for "Londn" (missing 'o')
Then the error message should be helpful
And ideally suggest similar city names if possible
```

### NCR-02: Performance Optimization
**Epic**: As a system administrator, I want optimal resource usage

#### Scenario: Memory Usage Stability
```gherkin
Given the server runs continuously for 24 hours
When processing normal weather request load
Then memory usage should remain stable
And there should be no significant memory leaks
And CPU usage should return to baseline between requests
```

#### Scenario: Caching for Performance
```gherkin
Given the same city is requested multiple times
When the requests happen within a reasonable timeframe
Then the server may cache responses to improve performance
And cached responses should still be accurate
And cache invalidation should prevent stale data
```

### NCR-03: Monitoring and Observability
**Epic**: As a developer, I need visibility into server health and performance

#### Scenario: Health Check Endpoint (Future)
```gherkin
Given monitoring tools need to check server health
When a health check is requested
Then the server should respond with health status
And include basic performance metrics
And indicate external API connectivity status
```

#### Scenario: Structured Logging (Future)
```gherkin
Given the server is processing requests
When any significant event occurs
Then appropriate log messages should be generated
And logs should be structured for easy parsing
And logs should not contain sensitive information
```
